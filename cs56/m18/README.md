course planner

UCSB courses. Set schedule for next quarter.

M18 FINAL REMARKS:

Our code creates a web app that has various tabs used for scheduling class for upcoming quarter.

There is a JSON String to Java Object converter, but has not been linked to the front end. This is something you may choose to do (combining the front end classes with the JSON converter classes into one file). All of that information is located in the skunkwork side-project:
http://github.com/ucsb-cs56-m18/ucsb-cs56-gauchocourses-sw1/

After that, you can learn to scrap the data with Java instead of Python.

With that completed, you can start the process to generate the schedules. Yay!

Also another thing to do is edit the tab name. That should be fun and swell.

Furthermore, you can add a dateabase for people to signup and save schedules if you would please and make the dropdown buttons in the "Make A Schedule Tab" prettier.

Good luck, have fun! We know you'll do great!
